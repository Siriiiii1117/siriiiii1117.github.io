We often make plots in data science

Here's tidyverse

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Here's a dataframe

```{r}
df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(100, mean = 1, sd = 2),
  y = 1 + 2*x +rnorm(100)
)
```

Here's a plot:

This seems to show:

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i$$

```{r}
df |> 
ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```
